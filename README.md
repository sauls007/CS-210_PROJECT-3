# CS-210_PROJECT-3
GROCERY ITEM FINDER
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
The project involves one opening a file with a list of items and then being about to count the frequency at which the item was bought and then printing them onto the screen. The user also had the ability to just choose one item and 
print the frequency of that single item. Furthermore, the items could be printed in histograms from instead of values and the user could also make a copy of the file.



What did you do particularly well?
I think I did as well as I could and I don't think I could have done any better without learning more techniques in C++.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by using Python as the item frequency counter as I would be able to control all the features as well as add more features and newer packages.



Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most difficult part I had of writing this code was the frequency counter as I wasn't sure how to use map features and the guide wasn't too helpful.The second hardest part was writing the 
histograms as even though I worked with them before it was hard to implement them in this project.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills that I found useful was creating backup files as often I seem to have problems with the original at times and this could something useful when making applications. Map was also very useful as it made the project much easier to build
and this could be implemented when trying to sort items from files for an application.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to make this project as readable as possible by implementing indenting when necessary as well as spacing each function separately. Additionally, I add void functions and a main function in which the main function could call back the void to do a certain task. 
Moreover, I added comments so that the reader of the code could understand what each function was doing.
